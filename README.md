# I code web3 ‚õìÔ∏è

I'm a cypherpunk acolyte and stoked about decentralized tech since 2018, I'm driven by the firm belief that we must reduce intermediaries to accelerate private data and compute and and transform the faang monoliths towards community driven business models with sustainability and accessibility in mind. I'm all in Ethereum/EVM/Solidity but easily excited about anything that comes up every now and then. 

Professionally I write, test, audit and maintain smart contracts and build frontends for them (preferably Next/React & Chakra, oc also shadcn/twcss). 

## Right now ‚è¨

I'm working as technical cofounder at welshare.health. We're developing a stack of applications, services and EVM contracts to empower AI research agents to discover and get in touch with user groups who can safely share data about health conditions relevant to their research requirements.  

## Some history ‚óÄÔ∏è

Previously I've proudly served as molecule.xyz's lead engineer to invent nothing less than the next big revolution in intellectual manufacturing: the DeSci ecosystem (with a focus on disrupting the pharmaceutic biotech space). At Molecule we were outlining legal primitives that combine on- and offchain building blocks to make intellectual property accessible, shareable and profitable for everyone. At Molecule I built tools to help operating DAOs, dashboards, fundraising contracts, bonding curves and market making helpers, cross chain ip token assets and interfaced this with decentralized storage systems.

Historically I'm a web developer with roots in Java and PHP land. In 2010 I rebuilt and rolled out Samsung Electronic's European Fun Club using Java Spring with a team of 12. In 2014 I went neck deep into the Symfony app framework, and helped building price comparison portals for services and retail goods. Besides React I'm familiar with sophisticated UX layers using Vue/Nuxt/Vuetify and Apollo Client.
