# I code web3 ‚õìÔ∏è

I'm a cypherpunk acolyte and stoked about decentralized tech since 2018, I'm driven by the firm belief that we must reduce intermediaries to accelerate private data and compute and and transform the faang monoliths towards community driven business models with sustainability and accessibility in mind. I'm all in Ethereum/EVM/Solidity but easily excited about anything that comes up every now and then. 

Professionally I write, test, audit and maintain smart contracts and build frontends for them (preferably Next/React & Chakra, oc also shadcn/twcss). 

## Right now ‚è¨

As you're reading this, I'm working as a full time lead engineer at molecule.xyz. Here we're inventing nothing less than the next big revolution in intellectual manufacturing: the DeSci ecosystem. Or focus lies on disrupting the pharmaceutic biotech space. We're outlining legal primitives that combine on- and offchain primitives to make intellectual property accessible, shareable and profitable for everyone. We build DAO tooling, dashboards, fundraising contracts, bonding curves and market making helpers, cross chain ip token assets and interfaces to decentralized storage systems.

## Some history ‚óÄÔ∏è

Historically I'm a web developer with roots in Java and PHP land. In 2010 I rebuilt and rolled out Samsung Electronic's European Fun Club using Java Spring with a team of 12. In 2014 I went neck deep into the Symfony app framework, and helped building price comparison portals for services and retail goods. Besides React I'm familiar with sophisticated UX layers using Vue/Nuxt/Vuetify and Apollo Client.
