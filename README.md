## âš¡ Developing the Third Web

I wrap my head around decentralized technology since 2018 and am a firm believer in the cultural and economic evolution that's driven by web3 technology and business primitives. As you only can focus on one ecosystem without losing your mind, I went all in with Ethereum, after having touchpoints with IOTA, BigchainDB, Polkadot and a little Cosmos. That's what I do all day: write, test, audit, maintain, monitor and evaluate smart contracts, build clever frontends (yep, I'm in React and Chakra) to make them usable and add sprinkles of decentralized storage, messaging and networks on top of it. 

### ðŸŒ± Right now

Right now, just as you're reading this, I'm working as a full time web3 engineer for molecule.to. Together with their mind blowing crew of professional coders, lawyers, scientists and web3 builders we're inventing nothing less than the next big revolution in intellectual manufacturing: the DeSci ecosphere. With a strong focus on disrupting the pharmaceutic biotech space molecule builds DAOs, technical and legal primitives to make intellectual property accessible, shareable and profitable for all of us. 

### Some history

Historically I'm a web developer with roots in Java and PHP land. I went deeply into the Symfony ecosoystem, built super powerful APIs with API platform and an even more sophisticated UX layer using Vuejs and Apollo on top of it. Between 2010 and 2012 I've also been utilising the all star Spring Framework to rebuild and roll out Samsung Electronic's European Fun Club from scratch. 

### ðŸ’¬ðŸ“« Like to get in touch?

Lets go, fren, don't hesitate. I'm a coder as you are and if you'd like to pick my brainz, help you evaluate an idea or want to team up for a hackathon (having me on the team bears a 65% guarantee of winning something), don't hesitate to poke me on any major network.
